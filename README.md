Wine Quality Prediction Using Random Forest and Streamlit

1. Introduction

The quality of wine depends on a variety of physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, chlorides, sulphates, and alcohol levels. Accurately predicting wine quality can help manufacturers, distributors, and consumers in assessing wine before formal tastings.
This project aims to build a machine learning model for predicting wine quality scores using the UCI Wine Quality Dataset, and deploy it through an interactive Streamlit application.

---

2. Data Description

Two datasets were used:

Red Wine Quality Dataset (`winequality-red.csv`)
White Wine Quality Dataset (`winequality-white.csv`)

Each dataset contains 11 input features (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol) and one target variable: quality (integer scores typically ranging from 3 to 9).

3. Methodology

3.1 Data Preprocessing

The target variable `quality` was separated from the input features.
Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure zero mean and unit variance.
This normalization ensures all features contribute equally to the model and improves training stability.

3.2 Model Selection

Random Forest Regressor was chosen as the predictive model due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and robustness to overfitting.
Hyperparameters were tuned separately for red and white wines:

Red Wine Model: `n_estimators=500`, `max_depth=60`
White Wine Model: `n_estimators=200`, `max_depth=22`

3.3 Training

Models were trained on the entire dataset after scaling.
Each Random Forest learned patterns between physicochemical features and wine quality scores.

4. Application Development

4.1 User Interface

Built with Streamlit, a Python library for interactive dashboards.
Provides a radio button to select wine type: red or white.
For each physicochemical feature, a slider is dynamically generated:

Minimum and maximum values match the dataset distribution.
 Default values set to the feature mean.
 User inputs are normalized with the same scaling approach used in training.

4.2 Prediction Workflow

1. User selects wine type.
2. User adjusts slider inputs for physicochemical properties.
3. Normalized input features are passed to the trained Random Forest model.
4. The model outputs a **predicted wine quality score.
5. Result is displayed on the Streamlit app as:
   “Predicted Wine Quality: X.X”

---

5. Results

The models are capable of predicting wine quality with reasonable accuracy for both red and white wines.
Predictions align with expected quality ranges based on alcohol content, acidity, and other key features.
The app provides an **intuitive interface** to simulate how changes in physicochemical properties influence predicted wine quality.

---

6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning (Random Forest Regression) in predicting wine quality. By integrating with Streamlit, the solution becomes interactive, user-friendly, and deployable for both experimentation and educational purposes.

Key contributions include:

A robust preprocessing and normalization pipeline.
Optimized Random Forest models for red and white wine datasets.
An interactive app allowing real-time input and prediction.

---
7. Future Enhancements

Evaluate performance metrics (RMSE, R²) on train/test splits for quantitative validation.
Extend to classification (high-quality vs. low-quality wines) for commercial use cases.
Incorporate explainability tools (e.g., SHAP values) to show which features influence predictions.
Deploy the Streamlit app publicly (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or Dockerized container)
